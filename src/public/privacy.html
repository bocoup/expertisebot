        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This is a legally binding contract between you and Bocoup, LLC. Please make sure you read it, because it is important. We’ve tried to make it as clear as possible, but we welcome feedback to <a href="mailto:hello@bocoup.com?subject=Privacy+Policy">hello@bocoup.com.</a>. In addition, we‘ve made these terms available under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license, so you can use and adapt them as you see fit.</p>

        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>

        <p>We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say "service",” we mean the bot you communicate with through Slack. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Bocoup LLC., a Massachusetts corporation. When we say “your content,” we mean any text, sound, graphics or other material which you post, upload, or otherwise share with the service. When we say “terms,” we mean this privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Accepting these terms</h2>

        <p>Please read these terms before using the service. <em>If you do not agree to these terms, you may not register for the service.</em> If we make material changes to these terms, we’ll let you know through the service. If you do not agree to those changes, you may discontinue use of the service. If you do not do so within ten days, the revised terms *will* apply to you. </p>

        <h2>3. Privacy policy</h2>

        <p>Through usage of the service you will grant us access to your content. We will not share it with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the services offered, to monitor usage, and to improve the service. For example, we may store your information on a third party server such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>. We may also use your information to send notifications about the service. We will <em>never</em> share your personal information with advertisers or send you promotions for unrelated services.</p>

        <p>We may be required to disclose your content in order to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>comply with the law or legal process;</li>
          <li>protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;</li>
          <li>enforce these terms; or</li>
          <li>respond to claims that the content of any material on our system violates the rights of others.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If we must disclose your content in order to comply with the law or legal process, we will inform you via the service as soon as practicable, provided that it is lawful for us to do so.</p>

        <p>We may also perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of our users to improve our service. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. This information will not contain your content. For example, we might want to share that a certain percentage of our users work most frequently in the mornings.</p>

        <h2>4. Copyright and intellectual property</h2>

        <p>We own our stuff; you own yours.</p>

        <p>You retain ownership of all content you post, upload to, or otherwise share on the service. However, by posting, uploading, or sharing your content, you grant us a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to access, use, and display your content in connection with the service and services we provide to you. This license permits us to perform the service that you registered for; for example, it permits us to store your content on redundant data servers, but it <em>does not</em> permit us to sell your content to advertisers or display your content other than to those you have authorized to view it, nor does it transfer the copyright to us. This license ends when you delete your account.</p>

        <p>In addition, the service may provide features that allow you to share your content with others. There are many things that others may do with that content, including copying it, modifying it, and re-sharing it. So, please consider carefully what you choose to share and with whom; we take no responsibility for that activity.</p>

        <h2>5. General</h2>

        <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the service in the courts located within Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and you also agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the service or these terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall be forever barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. If any provision contained in these terms is determined unenforceable, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of these terms shall be effective except pursuant to a written instrument signed by us expressly waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these terms and/or your use of the service. You may not assign any right, interest, or benefit provided under these terms or through the service without our express prior written consent. These terms set forth the entire agreement between you and us, and supersede any and all prior communications, agreements and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and us with respect to the service. A printed version of these terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these terms and/or your use of the service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>
