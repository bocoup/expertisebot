# Introduction
Hi, _____________. My name is ___________  and I'm going to be walking you through this session.

You probably already know, but let me explain why we've asked you to come here today: We're testing a slackbot that we're working on to see what it's like for actual people to use it.

I want to make it clear right away that we're testing the bot, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don't have to worry about making mistakes.

We want to hear exactly what you think, so please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We want to improve it, so we need to know honestly what you think.

As we go along, I'm going to ask you to think out loud, to tell me what's going through your mind. This will help us.

If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do when they don't have someone sitting next to them, but I will try to answer any questions you still have when we're done.

We have a lot to do, and I'm going to try to keep us moving, but we'll try to make sure that it's fun, too.

Do you have any questions before we begin?

# Background Information Questions

Before we look at the site, I'd like to ask you just a few quick questions. First, what's your role at Bocoup?

How do you (if you use it at all) currently use Skillsbot? What kind of information are you looking for?
What do you like about the experience? What could be improved on?

OK, great. We're done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.


# Usability Test

First, I'm just going to ask you to ask you to run a few commands. Prior to running each command I will ask you what information you expect the command to provide.

And again, as much as possible, **it will help us if you can try to think out loud so we know what you're thinking about.**

Commands:
- find
- for
- me 
- list 
- scales 
- stats 
- update 
- help
